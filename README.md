## Projects Below

### [Woma Programming Language](https://github.com/rjdbcm/woma) (No Longer Active)
  
  When developing C extensions for Python it is common to struggle with debugging. This is especially true of remote builds where you may not even have access to the proper system resources to find the source of a bug. There are tools like Cython that can help to reduce the chances of a encountering an error due to memory violations. These tools, however, are not 100% effective and you can still be left with particularly hard to debug errors. Woma aims to improve this by using contract-based constraints on function parameters and return values. This is combined with syntax that encourages writing and composing short functions. Additionally, runtime error messages are highly informative and Woma only allows procured access to Python internals.

### [Aspidites](https://github.com/rjdbcm/Aspidites) (No Longer Active)

  The reference implementation of the Woma Programming Language compiler that contains everything you need to build CPython extensions written in Woma.
  
### [BEAGLES](https://github.com/rjdbcm/BEAGLES) (No Longer Active)

  As part of my graduate degree, I worked on developing a software to save time on hand-quantification of behavioral videos of fruit flies. Normally this would involve taking notes of 10-minute behavioral assays. When you consider the number of test and control flies needed to reach statistical significance the time for the researcher is considerable. To better make use of research efforts I developed a GUI suite for annotating and quantifying behavioral video assays. These annotations were then fed into a neural network that, when trained, could be used to quantify video assays automatically. This human in the loop machine learning still fascinates me and I hope to continue this pursuit soon with better benchmarking tools at my disposal.

### [Sly Kernel](https://github.com/rjdbcm/slykernel) (No Longer Active)

   In 2008 I took it upon myself to learn the Ada programming language to write an x86 operating system kernel. This was written entirely from scratch, and I was able to learn a great deal about the lowest levels of programming and reading hardware specifications.
