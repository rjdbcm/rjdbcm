### Actively Maintained

#### [OZI](https://github.com/rjdbcm/ozi): Python Packaging for Meson
For years I just wanted packaging to work without my having to reorient myself to current best practices every time.
This is a solution I have developed to help me package python modules with Meson.
OZI can also help to synchronize packaging practices across packages using it, helping to reduce maintainance time.

### Not Maintained/Too Weird/Overly Ambitious

#### [BEAGLES](https://github.com/rjdbcm/BEAGLES)

  Software to save time on hand-quantification of behavioral videos of fruit flies. Normally this would involve taking notes of 10-minute behavioral assays. To better make use of research efforts I developed a GUI suite for annotating and quantifying behavioral video assays.

#### [Sly Kernel](https://github.com/rjdbcm/slykernel)

   In 2008 I took it upon myself to learn the Ada programming language to write an x86 operating system kernel. This was written entirely from scratch, and I was able to learn a great deal about the lowest levels of programming and reading hardware specifications. 

#### [Woma Programming Language](https://github.com/rjdbcm/woma)

  Turing tarpit DSL targetting CPython.

#### [Aspidites](https://github.com/rjdbcm/Aspidites)

  The reference implementation of the Woma Programming Language compiler that contains everything you need to build CPython extensions written in Woma.
